## AIM:
To Write a program to add the two numbers and print the result in percentage.
## ALGORITHM:
1. Include the standard input-output header file.
2. Define the main function.
3. Declare variables to store the two numbers.
4. Prompt the user to enter the first number.
5. Read the first number input from the user.
6. Prompt the user to enter the second number.
7. Read the second number input from the user.
8. Calculate the sum of the two numbers.
9. Print the result as a percentage by dividing the sum by 100 and displaying it.
## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a,b,c,d;
    scanf("%d%d",&a,&b);
    c=a+b;
    d=c/100;
    printf("Result:%d percent",d);
    return 0;
}
```
## OUTPUT:
